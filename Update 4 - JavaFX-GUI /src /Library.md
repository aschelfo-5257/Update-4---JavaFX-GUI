## Library GUI Class System

    [JavaFX GUI] ⇄ [Controller (Event Handling)] ⇄ [Model Classes] ⇄ [Database (SQL)]

## Step-by-Step Workflow: JavaFX GUI + SQL (JDBC): :computer:

**1.** Plan UI, classes, and DB schema
  
**2.** Build GUI with controls
  
**3.** Write Model classes

**4.** Connect to SQL database

**5.** Write DAO for DB queries

**6.** Handle GUI events with controller

**7.** Test GUI ↔ DAO ↔ Database connections

**8.** Final polish with validation & feedback

|    Layout Pane   |             Use Case              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
|     Vbox         | Vertical layout (top to bottom)   |
|     Hbox         | Horizontal layout                 |
|     GridPane     | Form-style (rows and columns)     |
|     BorderPane   | Divides layout into 5 areas       |
|     StackPane    | Stacks nodes on top of each other |

Your application must now include a fully constructed interface with:

- Windows

- Fields

- Buttons

- Menus or other JavaFX controls as needed

Use only JavaFX (no Swing, AWT, or console I/O).

**Note:** Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed (e.g., JDK 11 or later is often recommended for modern JavaFX development). You may also consider a JDK that bundles JavaFX, such as Liberica JDK Full, to avoid manually adding JavaFX dependencies.
